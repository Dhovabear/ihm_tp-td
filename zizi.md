# SOMEBODY
once told me the world is gonna roll me  
I aint the sharpest tool in a shed  
She was looking kind of dumb with a finger and a thumb  
in a shape of an L on her forhead.    
  
  
WELL  
The years start comming and they dont stop commin  
Fetch to the rules and hit the ground runnin  

didnt make sense not to live for fun , your brain get smart but your  
head get dumb. so much to do so much to see so much wrong with taking the backstreet  
You'l never know if you dont go go   
you'l never shine if you dont glow  
  
Hey now you'r a all star get the game on , go play  
Hey now you'r a rockstar get the show and get paid  
All that glitter is gold   
Only shooting star break the mold.
